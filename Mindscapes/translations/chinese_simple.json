    "Oh, hey little buddy! Got a talent for showing up in unexpected places, don’t ya? First you manage to find me all the way in Dark Bramble, then here you are showing up in my mind!": "哟，小家伙！你还真擅长出现在意想不到的地方，是吧？先是在黑棘星那头找到我，现在又跑到我的心灵空间里来了！",
    "Was there something you needed, or just showing off your knack for exploring the unexplorable?": "你是有什么事要找我，还是单纯想显摆你探索未知之地的本事？",
    "Sure I can! Buuuut, that would hardly be any fun now, would it? Since we’re in my mind, playing by my rules, I say you’ve gotta earn it. How you ask? Why a race course of… course.": "我当然可以！但——这多没意思啊，对吧？既然我们在我的心灵空间里，就得按我的规矩来，想知道答案就得自己挣。想知道怎么挣？那当然是跑个竞速赛道咯。",
    "Oh, but this won’t be any normal A to B race, no, more of an A B A B C race. You see those red spheres in the sky above us? I’m going to light one up green, then, once you’ve reached that, I’ll light one on the opposite end.": "不过这可不是普通的从A点到B点的赛跑，而是A-B-A-B-C式的赛道。看到我们头顶那些红色球体了吗？我会先把其中一个亮成绿色，等你抵达那个目标后，我再点亮对面的另一个。",
    "It’ll be your job to zip between them as fast as you can, ending with the highest one on the very top. I’ll give you… 50 seconds! That should be plenty of time for a pilot experienced enough to go through Dark Bramble.": "你的任务就是以最快速度在这些球体间穿梭，最后抵达最顶端那个最高的球体。我给你……50秒！对能闯过黑棘星的老练飞行员来说，这时间绰绰有余了。",
    "Just let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll start the timer once you reach the first goal": "准备好就告诉我，等你碰到第一个目标我就开始计时。",
    "So, ready to get started?": "怎么样，准备好开始了？",
    "That’s the spirit! I’ll give you 50 seconds from the first goal you touch, so you better hurry!": "这才对嘛！从你碰到第一个目标开始，我只给你50秒，可得抓紧了！",
    "Alright, let me know when you are!": "行，准备好了就说一声！",
    "Hmm, not quite fast enough, I don’t think. You can always try again though, so no pressure little buddy!": "嗯……我看速度还差了点哦。不过你随时可以再试，别有压力嘛小家伙！",
    "That’s how it’s done! That was blazing fast, we might make a decent astronaut out of you yet! Now, you asked me about Slate’s favorite memory…": "这就对了！速度快得离谱，说不定你能成为一名出色的宇航员呢！对了，你之前问我斯雷特最珍贵的回忆……",
    "Now, I know you did some fancy flying just now, but I still feel like it would be too easy to just tell you. So instead, here’s a hint; it has to do with our little space program.": "我知道你刚才飞得超棒，但就这么直接告诉你也太没意思了。不如给你个提示：这事和我们那支小小的太空探险队有关。",
    "Yep! Oh come on, don’t give me that look! You figured out how to navigate the most hostile planet in the solar system, I’m sure you can figure out what their favorite memory is.": "没猜错！哎呀，别那副表情嘛！你连太阳系里最凶险的星球都能闯明白，肯定能猜到斯雷特最珍贵的回忆是什么。",
    "Now get going, before I decide that you have to do another race!": "赶紧去忙吧，不然我可要让你再跑一轮喽！",
    "I was actually wondering if you could tell me about Slate’s favorite memory.": "其实我是想问问，你能不能告诉我斯雷特最珍贵的回忆是什么。",
    "Yep, let me at it!": "没问题，放马过来！",
    "Not just yet.": "还没准备好呢。",
    "That’s it?": "就这？",

    "Unfortunately, I can't let you through. Inner Slate made me to make sure nobody infiltrates their mind palace.": "抱歉啊，我不能让你进去。核心斯雷特创造我，就是为了防止有人潜入他的心灵宫殿。",
    "Sorry buddy, I don't make the rules, I just enforce them.": "对不起啦伙计，规矩不是我定的，我只是照章办事。",
    "...Yeah, sure you are. If you're really Slate, then do you mind telling me what Slate's favorite memory is?": "……呵，是吗。如果你真的是斯雷特，那不妨说说，斯雷特最珍贵的回忆是什么？",
    "Heh, fair enough. I wouldn't try too hard to figure it out either, Inner Slate keeps their mind locked up tighter than most. Heh, I bet the only way you could figure out their favorite memory would be by asking the travelers in their minds!": "哈，这要求合情合理。换我也不会费劲儿去猜——核心斯雷特把自己的心思锁得比谁都紧。哼，我敢说，想知道他最珍贵的回忆，唯一的办法就是去问他心灵空间里的那些旅行者！",
    "...Um, actually, forget that I said that.": "……呃，当我没说这话。",
    "Good guess! But no. I wouldn't try too hard to figure it out either, Inner Slate keeps their mind locked up tighter than most. Heh, I bet the only way you could figure out their favorite memory would be by asking the travelers in their minds!": "猜得挺准！但不对。换我也不会费劲儿去猜——核心斯雷特把自己的心思锁得比谁都紧。哼，我敢说，想知道他最珍贵的回忆，唯一的办法就是去问他心灵空间里的那些旅行者！",
    "...Um, actually, forget that I said that.": "……呃，当我没说这话。",

    "You pull who-knows-what to get inside my mind, then trick my personal mind palace guard into thinking that you're me, just to try and play some prank about the Sun exploding?": "你不知道用了什么鬼办法闯进我的心灵空间，还骗我心灵宫殿的专属守卫，让他以为你是我——就为了搞个“太阳要爆炸”的恶作剧？",
    "Honestly! I know we all call you Hatchling because you're our youngest member, but that doesn't give you an excuse to act like one!": "说真的！我知道大家都叫你小家伙是因为你是队里最年轻的，但这也不是你胡闹的理由啊！",
    "No! Here's what we're gonna do. First of all, you're gonna stop violating my privacy and get out of my head ASAP! Then, I'm gonna go talk to Hornfels and let them know that you still need some time to mature before you go into space.": "不行！听好了：首先，你立刻停止侵犯我的隐私，马上从我心灵空间里滚出去！然后我会去找霍恩费尔斯，跟他说你还得再历练历练，才能上天。",
    "Hatchling, I don't want to hear any apologies from you until you're out of my head.": "小家伙，在你离开我的心灵空间之前，我不想听你任何道歉。",
    "I... did all of that... you weren't kidding, were you hatchling? You actually are in a time loop? The Sun is actually going to explode? Everyone we know...": "我……我居然还怀疑你……小家伙，你没开玩笑？你真的被困在时间循环里了？太阳真的要爆炸了？我们认识的所有人……",
    "We've got to get moving! It'll be cramped, and it'll be even more rushed, but if we can get everybody aboard a ship we might be able to get away from the Sun in time!": "我们得行动起来！飞船会很挤，时间也会非常赶，但只要能让所有人都登上飞船，或许我们还能及时逃离太阳的爆炸范围！",
    "Quick! I opened a black hole in the doorway, it'll let you out of my mind without killing you horribly.": "快！我在门口开了个黑洞，从这儿出去能让你安全离开我的心灵空间，不会落得惨死的下场。",

    " Not now, sorry. I'm studying that star over there, I don't know why but... I have this feeling that something horrible is going to happen to it if I fail to figure out how to stop it.": "抱歉，现在没空。我在观测那边那颗恒星，不知道为什么……我总觉得，如果我找不到阻止它的办法，这颗星就要遭遇灭顶之灾了。",
    "I just wish that it was closer, all of the stars are so far away that it's a constant struggle to gather any data that actually tells me anything.": "真希望它能近一点啊——所有恒星都太远了，想收集到有价值的数据简直难如登天。",
    "Oh, wow! You actually brought it! This is going to make it so much easier to take readings from it!": "哇！你还真把它带来了！有了这个，观测数据会轻松多了！",

    "Slate's favorite memory? Well, I'm not totally- Oh, what an interesting sunspot! A bit larger than normal, I wonder why that is...": "斯雷特最珍贵的回忆？嗯，我其实不太确定——哦！这太阳黑子真有意思！比平时大不少，到底是为啥呢……",
    "Right, apologies. I'm honestly not totally sure, Slate always seemed the most at home around others though, so any sort of large gathering would probably be a good candidate.": "啊抱歉，跑神了。说实话我真不太清楚，但斯雷特向来在人群里最自在，所以大概率是和大型集会有关的事吧。",

    "Heh, sorry, can't say that I remember terribly well, even here in my mind. Especially with this beaten-up ship sitting here, I’m having to really focus on building up the resolve to move these creaky bones and fix it up.": "哈，抱歉，就算在自己的心灵空间里，我也记不太清了。尤其是看着这艘破船，我得费老大劲才能鼓起勇气，挪动这把老骨头去修它。",
    "That would be very kind of you Hatchling! If you do that, I’ll try and see what I can remember while you work. You might have some trouble getting to the higher parts of the ship, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.": "你真是太好心了，小家伙！要是你愿意修，我就趁你干活的时候好好回忆回忆。飞船高处的部分可能不太好够，但我相信你肯定有办法。",
    "Still working on repairs I see? I’ll let you know if I've remembered anything important once you're done. Remember to get the bits on top of the ship too! You'll just need to find some way to clamber up there.": "还在修呢？等你修好我要是想起啥关键的，肯定告诉你。记得把船顶的部件也修了！你得想办法爬上去才行。",
    "Y'know, can't say I particularly appreciate being climbed on, but you got the job done, Hatchling! And lucky for you, that boot to the head seems to have actually knocked a memory loose!": "虽说被你爬来爬去不怎么舒服吧，但活儿干得漂亮，小家伙！而且算你走运——你刚才那一脚好像把我的记忆给踹出来了！",
    "Unfortunately, I still don't remember much, but I remember Slate seeming exceedingly giddy a long time ago, well before I ever ended up on the Attelrock. That's all that I can remember, but I hope that it helps!": "可惜我还是记不太全，只记得很久以前——早在我去废岩星之前——斯雷特有过一次特别开心的时候。我就记得这些了，希望能帮到你！",

    "Oh, that's neat! I took a look at that when Gabbro brought it back, but wasn't able to make anything of it. I'm glad you figured out what it was for though! ...But why exactly did you use it on me?": "哇，好厉害！加布罗把那东西带回来的时候我看过，但完全没搞懂它的用途。还好你弄明白了！……不过你为什么用这个东西进入我的心灵空间啊？",
    "Oh! Um, I'm not totally sure, actually. I mean, I think I know what it is but... I'm not sure that's something I should tell you.": "哦！呃，其实我也不是很确定。我是说，我大概知道答案，但……我不确定该不该告诉你。",

    "I maybe should've guessed it wasn't a prank, since getting past my guard means you figured out what my favorite memory is. I still remember that night so clearly, Feldspar's voice carrying over the crowd, the excited looks on everyone as they were told that we were going to space...": "其实我早该猜到不是恶作剧的——能骗过我的守卫，说明你已经知道我最珍贵的回忆是什么了。那晚的场景我至今记忆犹新：费尔德斯巴的声音穿过人群，所有人听到我们要去太空的消息时，脸上都写满了兴奋……",
