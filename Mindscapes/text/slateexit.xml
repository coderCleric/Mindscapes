      <Page>Hey, before you go, I'm sorry for getting mad at you. I thought you were being a silly hatchling and trying to play a prank through massively unethical means and, well, got a bit more than a little annoyed.</Page>
      <Page>I maybe should've guessed it wasn't a prank, since getting past my guard means you figured out what my favorite memory is. I still remember that night so clearly, Feldspar's voice carrying over the crowd, the excited looks on everyone as they were told that we were going to space...</Page>
      <Page>Ah, I got caught up reminiscing. Don't let me hold you up any more, we've got business to get to!</Page>
