      <Page>In this display is a Nomai device found in the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Hanging City</color>]]> of <![CDATA[<color=orange>Brittle Hollow</color>]]>.</Page>
      <Page>It is not currently understood what this device was used for, but it is hoped that the recording, which was found next to the device, may provide some clues once translated.</Page>
      <Page>You might also notice that the usual protective case is not present on this exhibit. This is solely to provide access to the recording. Do NOT touch the device!</Page>
